                <p>The Chapel Hill Christmas Market was recently founded in 2024 by Carolina undergraduate students: Maggie Mulligan (Junior), Molly Bunta (Junior) and Kibby Hyacinth Pangilinan (Junior)! Maggie, Molly, and Kibby wanted to be able to share their love for the holidays on caampus while away from home!</p>
                <p>Although a Chapel Hill-born market, the Chapel Hill Christmas Market has pop-up events at each of the founder's respective home locations (check out the homepage to learn about these upcoming events!) The goal of the Chapel Hill Christmas Market is to provide a professionally managed community venue where customers can simulatenously immerse themselves within the holiday spirit while purchasing high-quality goods! </p>
                <p> We look forward to meeting you at our market! If you would like to stay up to date with all things Chapel Hill Christmas market, head over to our contact page to sign up for our newsletters! We can't wait to see you and share the joy of the season at our market!</p>
